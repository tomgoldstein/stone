# Overview
This repository implements the stone transform, and accompanying demos, for compressive sensing and reconstruction of video.  The STOne transform and its applications are described here.

To get started, run the `setupSTO.m` script.  Then, run a demo script like `testImagereconstruction.m` or `reconstructPendCar.m`.

# Some notes
The stone transform is implemented as a simple linear operator that acts on vectors with power-of-four length.  The transform itself is implemented in the max file `STO_fast.c`, and will need to be compiled before use.  This compilation should hopefully happen automatically with you call `setupSTO.m`.

To apply the transform to an image, you first need to map the image into a vector.  First, call the `createOrderingData.m` method.  
>> createOrderingData(256,'semi')

This is done by the method `
